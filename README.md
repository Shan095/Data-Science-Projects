# Data-Science-Projects
The objective of this project is to create a web application to calculate defaut payment possibility of a client. 
The front-end commercial adds the information of the client (annuity, income, family status, profession type...) and gets a score.
If the score is lower than 15, then the client is not considered to be a risky defaut payer, otherwise, yes. 
There are also various univarious analysis for variables showing the process of determination.
